# COVID-19 Data Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 case and vaccination data in India using various data science techniques and visualizations. The goal is to gain insights into the spread of the virus, vaccination progress, and key trends across different states.

# Project Features
COVID-19 Case Analysis:

# Data cleaning and transformation.
Calculation of active cases, recovery, and mortality rates by state.
State-wise comparisons of total confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
Top 10 states with the most active cases and deaths.
Time series analysis of the top affected states.

# Vaccination Data Analysis:
Analysis of state-wise vaccination progress.
Gender distribution of vaccinations (male vs female).
Identification of states with the highest total vaccinations.
Visualizations of top vaccinated states.

# Visualizations:
Bar plots of the top 10 states with the highest active cases and death rates.
Line plots tracking COVID-19 trends over time for highly affected states.
Pie charts representing male and female vaccination distribution.
Bar charts for top vaccinated states.
